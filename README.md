This is an active in work repository for Malware Analysis and training.

This is where content will be published in line with the work I have
been doing in my free time and will serve as a proof of concept
of the skills learned by doing so. This repository is intended to 
contain the works and write ups in an attempt to analyse malware
samples found from a variety of resources. 

Please direct all comments/suggestions/work inquires to:
